# Model Colour Editor
## Features
- Convert material colours to vertex colours on import
- Override vertex colours on a per-mesh basis with a centralised editor
- Extendable interface for generating colours for sets of meshes via custom Scriptable Objects

## Installation
Install via one of the following options:
- Add the following Git URL to the Unity Package Manager:
  >```https://github.com/samcrisp/model-colour-editor.git#release```
- [Download the latest package](https://github.com/samcrisp/model-colour-editor/releases/latest) and install in either of the following ways:
  - Open the Package Manager and select "Import package from disk..." and select the .unitypackage file.
  - From the Assets menu select "Import Package > Custom Package..." and select the .unitypackage file. Model Colour Editor requires the [Editor Coroutines](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.editorcoroutines@1.0/manual/index.html) package to be installed as a dependency. Installing this way will not resolve the dependency automatically. You can either install Editor Coroutines manually before importing the Model Colour Editor package or move the Model Colour Editor from the Asset folder and into the Packages folder of your project and Unity will install the dependent package automatically.
